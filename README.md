# Optimize Flight Scheduling to Enhance Operational Efficiency and Customer Satisfaction

Flight delays are an ongoing issue which significantly impact airline industry. How to measure and predict flight delays would help airline companies optimize their flight arrangement, minimize potential loss and maximize performance. This project explores the key factors in building models to predict flight delays such as Carrier and Distance and try to find the most relevant predictor. This project applies different algorithms to convert categorical predictors and predict flight delays. In this project, several classifier algorithms including KNN Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost Classifier will be used to evaluate which algorithm performs best in predicting flight delays with a highest accuracy rate. This project also splits the dataset into training set and testing set to verify the prediction of the predictive model and visualized the result.
